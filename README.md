This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains code that attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers without handling the case of an empty list, which results in a division by zero. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that checks for an empty list before performing the calculation, preventing the error.
